# Ongoing ETL Data Pipeline with PySpark and Plotly

The ETL Data Pipeline project is an ongoing project that aims to implement an end-to-end data processing and visualization pipeline using PySpark and Plotly. The pipeline focuses on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for financial data, enabling users to gain insights into financial trends and patterns.

## Project Status

This project is currently ongoing. The initial setup and codebase have been completed, but the data processing and visualization components are still being developed. Check back for updates as the project progresses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Plotly library

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/etl-data-pipeline.git
cd etl-data-pipeline
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pyspark plotly
```

## Usage

1. Ensure your Apache Spark cluster is running and accessible.

2. Run the ETL data pipeline:

```bash
python etl_pipeline.py
```

3. The pipeline will perform the following steps:

   - **Extract**: Connect to the Global Financial Data database and retrieve financial data.

   - **Transform**: Process the data using PySpark to clean, aggregate, and transform it into a suitable format.

   - **Load**: Generate visualizations using Plotly to present the financial trends.

4. The generated visualizations will be saved as interactive HTML files that can be opened in a web browser.
